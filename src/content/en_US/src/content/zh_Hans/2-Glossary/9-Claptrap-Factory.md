## Claptrap Factory assembles Claptrap.

Claptrap has a high degree of customization.Developers can specify a custom set of components for the Claptrap object, such as Event Loader/Event Saver/State Saver/State Saver/Event Notification Method, and so on.In order to adapt to this customizable nature, good options are needed for the assembly of Claptrap objects.

The current framework is selected by Autofac as an assembler.The main reason is that Autofac supports the Delegate Factory/Decorator/Generic Type/Module and more features that are richer compared to the System.Dependencynjection.

## Claptrap Factory controls the Claptrap lifetime scope.
